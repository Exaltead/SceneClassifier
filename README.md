# SceneClassifier

Prerequirites:

This application requres Andrdoid 7.0 to function. In addition the application is written in kotlin for which I would highly recommend Andrdoid Studio 3+. Dataprocessing uses TarosDSP https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP. Release .jar of the TarosDSP is included in the project to ease the development. Also includes http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/audio/javaWavFiles.html for maangement of wav files.
